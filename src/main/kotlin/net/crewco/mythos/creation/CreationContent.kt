/**
 * The cast and the score of the first age.
 *
 * Two different gates are on show here, and they're the whole point of the design:
 *
 *  - **The Primordials are CLAIMED.** Eight seats, and once they're gone they're
 *    gone — everyone else is a spirit, in the queue, waiting.
 *  - **The Titans are NOT claimed. They are BORN.** No player can `/claim kronos`;
 *    the only way into a Titan is for whoever holds Gaia to reach into the spirit
 *    world and pull someone out of it (`/power birth <spirit> <titan>`).
 *
 * That second one is what makes the server a story instead of a lobby: one player's
 * power over another player's *existence*, which is exactly the deal Greek myth
 * is actually about.
